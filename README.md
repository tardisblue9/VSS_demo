# VSS_demo
A practice on verified secret sharing, based on Feldmanâ€™s verifiable secret sharing protocol.
For personal reference...

The x can be changed to random choice on the finite field, instead of range(k) in my case. x_i just need to be integers falling into the specific range.
Also, the initial prime should be of random choice over large primes, instead my case, which is a fixed number. Though the prime chosen should be standing for the range of finite space.
